# RestaurantSearch
a simple exercise for my android skills

Tech stack:
1. RxJava dealing with run time query with 500 milliseconds as debounce time
2. Hilt as dependency injection tool
3. MVVM + LiveData
4. SharedPreference is used to save and sync liked restaurants
5. navigation graph is used to do simple navigation

What's done:
1. Basic restaurant search functionality based user's current location
2. on time search with debounce time as 500ms
3. List view + Map View
4. onClick marker to show details of restaurant
